# AMPds2: The Almanac of Minutely Power dataset (Version 2)

**Description**

This dataset is intended to be multi-year capture of the consumption of my
house. This dataset contains electricity, water, and natural gas measurements at
one minute intervals. This dataset contains a total of 1,051,200 readings for 2
years of monitoring (from April/2012 to March/2014) per meter. There are a total
of 21 power meters, 2 water meters (with additional appliance usage
annotations), and 2 natural gas meters. Weather data from Environment Canada's
YVR weather station has also been added. This hourly weather data covers the
same period of time as AMPds and includes a summary of climate normals observed
from the years between 1981-2010. Billing data from utility companies is also
included for cost/benefit analysis. (2015-05-07)
