# Aalto Univeristy IoT SENTINEL: IoT devices captures

**Description**

This dataset represents the traffic emitted during the setup of 31 smart home
IoT devices of 27 different types (4 types are represented by 2 devices each).
Each setup was repeated at least 20 times per device-type. Each directory
contains several pcap files, each representing a setup of the given device
directory. Files are named Setup-X-Y-STA.pcap where X is the person realizing
the setup and Y is the sequence number of the given capture. The file
_iotdevice-mac.txt contains the MAC address of the considered IoT device.
