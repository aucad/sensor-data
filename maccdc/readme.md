# Mid-Atlantic CCDC (MACCDC)

Capture files from Mid-Atlantic CCDC.

Each team is given physically identical computer configurations at the start of
the competition. Throughout the competition, the teams have to ensure the
systems supply the specified services while under attack from a volunteer Red
Team. In addition, the teams have to satisfy periodic “injects” that simulate
business activities IT staff must deal with in the real world.
