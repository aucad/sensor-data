# MavLab dataset

**Description**

These datasets represent sensor events collected in the MavLab testbed
during March and April of 2003.  During this time approximately six students
worked in the lab on a regular basis.

**Sensor layouts**

Layout of the sensors in the testbed and a few image captures of the environment:
