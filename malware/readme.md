# Malware on IoT Dataset Aposemat

**Description**

One of the main goals of our Aposemat project is to obtain and use real IoT
malware to infect the devices in order to create up to date datasets for
research purposes. The datasets will be available to the public and published
regularly in the Malware on IoT Dataset page.
