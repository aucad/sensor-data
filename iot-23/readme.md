# Stratosphere Laboratory’s Aposemat IoT-23

**Description**

A labeled dataset with malicious and benign IoT network traffic.

IoT-23 is a new dataset of network traffic from Internet of Things (IoT)
devices. It has 20 malware captures executed in IoT devices, and 3 captures for
benign IoT devices traffic. It was first published in January 2020, with
captures ranging from 2018 to 2019. This IoT network traffic was captured in the
Stratosphere Laboratory, AIC group, FEL, CTU University, Czech Republic. Its
goal is to offer a large dataset of real and labeled IoT malware infections and
IoT benign traffic for researchers to develop machine learning algorithms. This
dataset and its research is funded by Avast Software, Prague.
